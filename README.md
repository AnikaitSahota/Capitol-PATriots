# Analysing the activites on Parler that lead to USA capitol roits

Re-implemented the [reserch paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06914) about the study of social media activies in regarding [2021 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack).

On 6 January 2021, a mob of right-wing conservatives stormed the USA Capitol Hill interrupting the session of congress certifying 2020 Presidential election results. Immediately after the start of the event, posts related to the riots started to trend on social media. A social media platform which stood out was a free speech endorsing social media platform Parler; it is being claimed as the platform on which the riots were planned and talked about. I tried to examine the claims done by research paper.
